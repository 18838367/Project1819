login nodes -- > scheduler -- Compute nodes


login nodes 
- dont run work here, just for moving around and submiting jobs 
- run on compute nodes 
- different hardware to compute nodes, jobs may fail on login nodes but not on compute nodes
- many people share the same login node (~100)


Compute nodes 
- access provided by the scheduler, manages the queue 
- parallelism is how significant performance increases are achieved 
- fast interconnect between compute nodes 
- jobs can span mutliple compute nodes 
- each compute node has one or more CPU's 
- each CPU has mutiple cores
- each CPU has memory attached to it L3 cache 
- each node has na external network connection 
- some systems have accelerators e.g. GPU's

High Performance Storage
- fast storage inside the SC
- temporary working area 
-- might have local node storage 
 - not shared with other users 
- usually have global storage 
	- all nodes can access the filesystems 
	- either directly connected to the interconnect or via the router nodes 
	- the storage is shared, multiple simultaneous users on different nodes will reduce performance 

Data Mover Nodes
- more or less like the login nodes except you can't log into them 
[hpc-data.pawsey.org.au]

Scheduler
- the scheduler is playing tetris with the system
- as a user you describe the shape of the job to the scheudler and it figures out where best to fit your job in the queue 


Magnus CRAY XC40 1488  compute nodes 24 cores per node 64GB RAM/node Aries interconnect (very special) (72 Giga bits per second)
- for large parallel workflows 
Galaxy CRAY XC30 472 nodes 20 cores per node 64GB RAM/node Aries interconnect
- For radio astronomy almost exclusively 
Zeus HPE cluster 90 nodes 28 cores/node 98-129 GB RAM/node has lots of different kinds of nodes 


SCRATCH 
- high performance temp storage 
- 30 day lifetime then files are purged 
- no touching files 
- pls delete them before they are purged (better for filesystem as there is a load for the filesystem to do it itself)
- $MYSCRATCH

Group filesystem
- high performance but not as fast scratch 
- default 1TB quota
- $MYGROUP

Home filesystem 
- configs and small input files 
- small quota 
- slow 
- dont use it unless you have to 
- $HOME
